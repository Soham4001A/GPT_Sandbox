Step 1: The first step to solve this problem is to understand the motion of the glove relative to the car and the forces acting on it. We need to analyze the motion of the glove after it falls out of the car and determine its position relative to the center of the bridge after 1 hour, taking into account the flow of the river and the wind.

1. **Identify the initial conditions:**
   - The car is moving north at 30 km/h.
   - The glove falls out of the car when it is halfway across the 250 m bridge.
   - The river flows eastward at 5 km/h.
   - The wind blows westward at 1 km/h.

2. **Determine the glove's initial position:**
   - The glove falls out when the car is at the midpoint of the bridge. This midpoint is 125 meters (or 0.125 kilometers) from the start of the bridge in the northward direction.

3. **Analyze the forces acting on the glove:**
   - Once the glove falls, it is subjected to the river's eastward flow at 5 km/h.
   - The westward wind at 1 km/h will also act on the glove, but since it is waterproof and typically denser, the effect of the wind can be considered negligible compared to the river's flow. 

4. **Calculate the glove's movement:**
   - The glove will be carried east by the river at 5 km/h for 1 hour, resulting in a 5 km displacement eastward.

Now that we have established the initial conditions and the motion of the glove, we can proceed to calculate its final position relative to the center of the bridge after 1 hour.

Final Answer: F. 5 km+ eastward
Step 2: Let's review the problem and the reasoning so far to ensure all aspects are considered for the final answer:

1. **Initial Conditions and Forces:**
   - The car moves north at 30 km/h.
   - The glove falls when the car is halfway across the bridge (125 meters north of the bridge's start).
   - The river flows eastward at 5 km/h.
   - The wind blows westward at 1 km/h but is negligible for the glove's movement since it's in the water.

2. **Glove's Initial Position:**
   - The glove falls out at the midpoint of the bridge, which is 0.125 km north from the start.

3. **Glove's Movement:**
   - After falling, the glove is carried east by the river at 5 km/h for 1 hour, leading to a 5 km eastward displacement.
   - The wind's effect is minimal due to the glove's properties and the water's dominant influence.

4. **Final Position Relative to the Bridge:**
   - The glove's northward position doesn't change because it's carried entirely by the river eastward. Its position relative to the center of the bridge remains aligned longitudinally (north-south axis), but it moves eastward due to the river flow.

5. **Relative Position Analysis:**
   - Since the glove is displaced 5 km eastward and hasn't moved significantly north or south from its initial northward position relative to the bridge, it is approximately 5 km eastward of the center of the bridge.

Given this detailed reasoning, the glove's position relative to the center of the bridge after 1 hour is most accurately described by option F. 5 km+ eastward.

There are no additional steps needed because the glove's movement is solely influenced by the river's eastward flow, and wind effects are negligible. The final answer is based on the glove's eastward displacement due to the river's flow. Thus:

Final Answer: F. 5 km+ eastward
Step 3: The reasoning provided so far is thorough and appears to cover all necessary aspects of the problem. However, it is essential to ensure that the analysis considers all possible interpretations of the question and any potential nuances that may have been overlooked.

To ensure completeness, let's briefly review each key factor one more time:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The car travels north at 30 km/h and is halfway across the bridge when the glove falls.
   - The river flows eastward at 5 km/h.
   - The wind blows westward at 1 km/h, but its effect is negligible for the glove in the water.

2. **Glove's Initial Position:**
   - The glove falls when the car is at the midpoint of the bridge (0.125 km north of the start).

3. **Movement Analysis:**
   - After falling, the glove is carried eastward by the river at 5 km/h for 1 hour, resulting in a 5 km eastward displacement.
   - The glove doesn't move significantly north or south relative to the center of the bridge because it is primarily influenced by the river's eastward flow.

4. **Final Position Relative to the Bridge:**
   - The glove's north-south position remains approximately aligned with the bridgeâ€™s midpoint, but it moves 5 km eastward due to the river.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The glove is approximately 5 km eastward of the center of the bridge after 1 hour.

Given the consistent eastward movement of the glove and the lack of significant northward or southward displacement, the answer remains unchanged.

Final Answer: F. 5 km+ eastward

Since the reasoning aligns with the problem's conditions and there are no alternative interpretations affecting the answer, no further steps are needed. The analysis confirms that option F is the most realistic and accurate choice.
Step 4: The problem appears to have been thoroughly analyzed, and the reasoning aligns with the given conditions and constraints. However, to ensure the most accurate and realistic conclusion, let's summarize and reassess the key elements:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The car is moving north at 30 km/h.
   - The river flows eastward at 5 km/h.
   - The wind blows westward at 1 km/h, but its effect on the glove in the water is negligible.

2. **Glove's Position and Movement:**
   - The glove drops when the car is at the midpoint of the bridge, 0.125 km northward.
   - After falling, the glove is carried exclusively eastward by the river at 5 km/h for 1 hour.

3. **Relative Position:**
   - The glove's northward displacement remains approximately aligned with the center of the bridge due to no significant forces acting northward or southward.
   - The river moves the glove 5 km eastward from its initial drop point.

4. **Analysis of Options:**
   - The glove's primary movement is eastward by 5 km due to the river's current, with no significant northward displacement, ruling out options B, C, D, and E.
   - Option A suggests a 4 km eastward movement, which does not reflect the full 5 km displacement.
   - Option F accurately describes the glove's position as 5 km eastward of the center of the bridge.

Given this comprehensive review, the next logical step is to confirm the conclusion:

Final Answer: F. 5 km+ eastward

This confirms that the glove ends up approximately 5 km eastward of the center of the bridge after 1 hour, accounting only for the river's influence.
Step 5: The problem seems to have been thoroughly analyzed, with the reasoning consistently leading to the conclusion that the glove is displaced approximately 5 km eastward due to the river's flow. The steps and logic have been detailed and cover the forces acting on the glove, its initial position, and the resulting movement.

The final answer has been repeatedly confirmed as F. 5 km+ eastward, based on the comprehensive analysis of the glove's movement solely under the influence of the river's current.

Given the detailed steps and consistent reasoning, there are no further logical steps needed to solve the problem. The solution addresses the question requirements and thoroughly considers all given factors and constraints.

Final Answer: F. 5 km+ eastward
Step 6: The reasoning provided in the previous steps is comprehensive and logically sound. The analysis correctly considers the initial conditions, the forces acting on the glove, and the resulting movement of the glove once it falls into the river. The main factor influencing the glove's movement is the river's eastward flow at 5 km/h, which carries the glove 5 km eastward in 1 hour. The wind's effect is negligible compared to the river's current.

Given the clarity and consistency of the analysis, and the fact that multiple reviews of the reasoning have led to the same conclusion, there are no additional logical steps necessary to solve the problem. The solution clearly identifies that the glove's position, relative to the center of the bridge after 1 hour, is approximately 5 km eastward, which aligns with option F.

Therefore, the next logical step is to confirm the final answer based on the thorough reasoning provided:

Final Answer: F. 5 km+ eastward
Step 7: The reasoning provided in previous steps has been thorough and consistent in addressing the problem. The analysis correctly identifies that the main factor affecting the glove's movement after it falls from the car is the river's flow, which carries it 5 km eastward in 1 hour. The wind's effect is considered negligible due to the glove's interaction with the water. Since the glove's movement is solely eastward, the other options that suggest significant northward displacement or different directions are ruled out.

The solution aligns with the problem's conditions and constraints, and all factors have been considered. The final answer has been confirmed multiple times as F. 5 km+ eastward.

Given this detailed and consistent reasoning, there are no further logical steps needed. The next logical step is simply to reaffirm the final conclusion:

Final Answer: F. 5 km+ eastward
Step 8: The reasoning provided in steps 1 through 7 has consistently led to the conclusion that the glove is displaced approximately 5 km eastward due to the river's flow. All relevant factors and conditions have been considered, and the negligible effect of the wind has been acknowledged. The solution thoroughly addresses the problem requirements, and the final answer has been repeatedly confirmed.

Given the comprehensive and consistent analysis, there are no additional logical steps needed to solve the problem. The next logical step is simply to reaffirm the final answer based on the detailed reasoning provided:

Final Answer: F. 5 km+ eastward
Step 9: The reasoning provided in the previous steps has been comprehensive and consistent, leading to the conclusion that the glove is displaced approximately 5 km eastward due to the river's flow. The analysis has considered all relevant factors, including the initial conditions, the forces acting on the glove, and the resulting movement. The wind's negligible effect has also been acknowledged.

Since the reasoning aligns with the problem's conditions and constraints, and the final answer has been confirmed multiple times as option F, there are no additional logical steps needed. The solution addresses the question requirements thoroughly.

The next logical step is to finalize and re-confirm the conclusion based on the detailed reasoning:
