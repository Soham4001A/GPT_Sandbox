Step 1: The first step is to determine the total number of ice cubes placed in the pan over the three minutes. We know the average number of ice cubes per minute is five, and there are four minutes in total (since the pan was frying a crispy egg for four minutes). Therefore, we calculate the total number of ice cubes by multiplying the average by the total number of minutes:

\[ \text{Total ice cubes} = \text{Average number per minute} \times \text{Total minutes} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \]

Now we know the total number of ice cubes is 20. With this information, we can move to the next step to determine how many ice cubes were placed in the third minute.
Step 2: To continue solving the problem, we need to determine how many ice cubes Beth placed in the pan during the third minute, given the information we've calculated so far.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of ice cubes placed in the third minute.**

1. **Determine the number of ice cubes placed in the first two minutes.**
   - As given, Beth placed 4 ice cubes in the first minute and 5 ice cubes in the second minute. 
   - Therefore, the total number of ice cubes placed in the first two minutes is:
     \[
     4 \, (\text{first minute}) + 5 \, (\text{second minute}) = 9
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of ice cubes placed in the third minute.**
   - We have already calculated the total number of ice cubes over the four minutes is 20.
   - Since no ice cubes are placed in the fourth minute, the total number of ice cubes placed in the first three minutes is 20.
   - Therefore, the number of ice cubes placed in the third minute is:
     \[
     \text{Total ice cubes} - \text{Ice cubes in first two minutes} = 20 - 9 = 11
     \]

**Step 3: Determine the number of whole ice cubes in the pan at the end of the third minute.**

Since the problem does not mention any melting or removal of ice cubes before the end of the third minute, and assuming all ice cubes remain intact:

- The total number of ice cubes in the pan at the end of the third minute is the sum of ice cubes placed in the first, second, and third minutes:
  \[
  4 \, (\text{first minute}) + 5 \, (\text{second minute}) + 11 \, (\text{third minute}) = 20
  \]

Thus, the number of whole ice cubes in the pan at the end of the third minute is 20.

Therefore, the correct answer is \( \boxed{20} \).
Step 3: The reasoning and steps already taken have led to the conclusion that the total number of ice cubes in the pan at the end of the third minute is 20. Since the problem has been addressed holistically, and the number of ice cubes in the pan aligns with the given average, there is no further calculation needed. The logical steps have already resolved the problem, confirming that the number of whole ice cubes in the pan at the end of the third minute is indeed 20.

Thus, the final answer to the problem is \( \boxed{20} \), and there are no additional steps required.
Step 4: The reasoning and calculations provided have already led to a consistent conclusion. Here are the logical steps clearly outlined:

1. **Total Ice Cubes Calculation:** 
   - The average number of ice cubes per minute is given as 5 for 4 minutes. Therefore, the total number of ice cubes placed is \(5 \times 4 = 20\).

2. **Ice Cubes in the First Two Minutes:**
   - Beth placed 4 ice cubes in the first minute and 5 in the second minute, totaling \(4 + 5 = 9\) ice cubes.

3. **Ice Cubes in the Third Minute:**
   - Since no ice cubes are placed in the fourth minute, all 20 ice cubes must have been placed by the end of the third minute. Therefore, the number of ice cubes placed in the third minute is \(20 - 9 = 11\).

4. **Total Ice Cubes in the Pan at the End of the Third Minute:**
   - Assuming no melting or removal occurs, the total number of ice cubes in the pan at the end of the third minute is the sum of ice cubes placed in the first, second, and third minutes:
     \[
     4 \, (\text{first minute}) + 5 \, (\text{second minute}) + 11 \, (\text{third minute}) = 20
     \]

Since the problem statement does not mention any melting or removal of ice cubes, the reasoning is complete, and the conclusion is that the number of whole ice cubes in the pan at the end of the third minute is indeed 20. Therefore, the correct answer to the problem is \( \boxed{20} \).

There are no further logical steps needed to solve the problem as all necessary calculations have been made, and assumptions have been clearly stated.
Step 5: The reasoning provided so far is thorough and logically consistent. All calculations and assumptions have been made to determine the number of whole ice cubes in the pan at the end of the third minute. Here’s a summary of the key points:

1. **Total Ice Cubes Calculation:**
   - The total number of ice cubes placed over four minutes, based on the average of 5 cubes per minute, is \(5 \times 4 = 20\).

2. **Ice Cubes in the First Two Minutes:**
   - Beth placed 4 ice cubes in the first minute and 5 in the second minute, totaling 9 ice cubes.

3. **Ice Cubes in the Third Minute:**
   - Since no ice cubes were placed in the fourth minute, the remaining ice cubes to reach a total of 20 must have been placed in the third minute: \(20 - 9 = 11\).

4. **Total Ice Cubes in the Pan:**
   - The total number of ice cubes in the pan at the end of the third minute is \(4 + 5 + 11 = 20\).

Given that the problem does not mention any melting or removal of ice cubes, the conclusion that there are 20 ice cubes at the end of the third minute is correct. 

Thus, the solution is complete, and the final answer to the problem is \( \boxed{20} \). There are no additional steps required, as all aspects of the problem have been addressed.
Step 6: The reasoning provided in the previous steps already contains an error. Let's reevaluate the problem from the beginning with clear and logical steps to arrive at the correct solution.

### Problem Restatement:
Beth places ice cubes in a pan over four minutes with the following details:
- 4 ice cubes in the first minute.
- 5 ice cubes in the second minute.
- Some unknown number of ice cubes in the third minute.
- 0 ice cubes in the fourth minute.

The average number of ice cubes placed per minute over the four minutes is 5.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Step 1: Calculate Total Ice Cubes Over Four Minutes**

Since the average number of ice cubes placed per minute is 5, and this average is calculated over 4 minutes, the total number of ice cubes is:
\[
\text{Total ice cubes} = 5 \times 4 = 20
\]

**Step 2: Determine Ice Cubes Placed in the First Two Minutes**

Beth places:
- 4 ice cubes in the first minute.
- 5 ice cubes in the second minute.

The total for the first two minutes is:
\[
4 + 5 = 9 \text{ ice cubes}
\]

**Step 3: Determine Ice Cubes Placed in the Third Minute**

To find out how many ice cubes were placed in the third minute:
- We know the total ice cubes placed in the first three minutes must account for all 20 since none are added in the fourth minute.
- Subtract the ice cubes placed in the first two minutes from the total:

\[
\text{Ice cubes in the third minute} = 20 - 9 = 11
\]

**Step 4: Total Ice Cubes in the Pan at the End of the Third Minute**

Since there are no ice cubes added in the fourth minute, and no melting or removal of ice cubes is mentioned, the total number of ice cubes in the pan at the end of the third minute is simply the sum of those placed in the first, second, and third minutes:
\[
4 + 5 + 11 = 20
\]

The previous analysis confirms that the correct answer is 20 ice cubes. However, the options provided in the problem do not include 20. Therefore, we need to reevaluate the context or constraints to ensure the calculations align with the choices given. 

Since the problem states the average is 5 over
Step 7: Let's carefully evaluate the problem with the options provided. Given the steps mentioned earlier, here’s a critical review of the calculations and assumptions:

### Problem Restatement:
Beth places ice cubes in a pan over four minutes with these specifics:
- 4 ice cubes in the first minute.
- 5 ice cubes in the second minute.
- An unknown number of ice cubes in the third minute.
- 0 ice cubes in the fourth minute.

The average number of ice cubes placed per minute over the four minutes is 5.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Step 1: Calculate Total Ice Cubes Over Four Minutes**

The average number of ice cubes per minute is 5, calculated over 4 minutes. Therefore, the total number of ice cubes is:
\[
\text{Total ice cubes} = 5 \times 4 = 20
\]

**Step 2: Determine Ice Cubes Placed in the First Two Minutes**

Beth places:
- 4 ice cubes in the first minute.
- 5 ice cubes in the second minute.

The total for the first two minutes is:
\[
4 + 5 = 9 \text{ ice cubes}
\]

**Step 3: Determine Ice Cubes Placed in the Third Minute**

Since no ice cubes were placed in the fourth minute, all 20 ice cubes must be accounted for by the end of the third minute. Therefore, the number of ice cubes placed in the third minute is:
\[
\text{Ice cubes in the third minute} = 20 - 9 = 11
\]

### Re-evaluation with the Given Options:
The total number of ice cubes placed by the end of the third minute is 20. However, the options provided in the problem are: 30, 0, 20, 10, 11, and 5.

Here’s the logical error in the earlier analysis:
- The calculation indeed confirms that 20 ice cubes are placed in total, but the problem asks for how many whole ice cubes can be found in the pan at the end of the third minute, not just the total placed. 

### Clarification:
Since the problem does not mention any melting or removal of ice cubes before the end of the third minute, we initially thought this meant all cubes placed are present. However, since the problem's options only include numbers up to 30, and the answer we calculated doesn't match any provided options, we need to
