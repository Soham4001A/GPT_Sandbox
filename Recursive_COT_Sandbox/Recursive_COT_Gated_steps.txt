Step 1: The first step is to calculate the total number of minutes the frying process lasted. We know that ice cubes were placed in the pan at the start of the first, second, and third minutes, and none were placed in the fourth minute. This indicates that the frying process lasted for three minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of ice cubes placed in the pan over these three minutes, given that the average number of ice cubes per minute was five. The average is calculated as the total number of ice cubes divided by the total number of minutes. Therefore, the total number of ice cubes placed in the pan is:

Total ice cubes = Average ice cubes per minute * Number of minutes
Total ice cubes = 5 * 3 = 15Step 2: Step 2: Now that we have determined that a total of 15 ice cubes were placed in the pan over the three minutes, let's calculate how many ice cubes were placed during each minute based on the information given:

- In the first minute, Beth placed 4 ice cubes.
- In the second minute, Beth placed 5 ice cubes.

Step 3: Let's determine how many ice cubes were placed at the start of the third minute. We know the total number of ice cubes placed over the three minutes is 15. Therefore, we can calculate the number of ice cubes placed in the third minute as follows:

Ice cubes in the third minute = Total ice cubes - (Ice cubes in the first minute + Ice cubes in the second minuteStep 3: Step 4: In the previous steps, we calculated that the total number of ice cubes placed over the three minutes was 15, and we know that 4 ice cubes were placed in the first minute and 5 ice cubes were placed in the second minute. Now, we need to calculate the number of ice cubes placed in the third minute.

To find the number of ice cubes placed in the third minute, we subtract the number of ice cubes placed in the first and second minutes from the total number of ice cubes:

Ice cubes in the third minute = Total ice cubes - (Ice cubes in the first minute + Ice cubes in the second minute)  
Ice cubes in the third minute = 15 - (4 + 5)  
IceStep 4: Step 5: Continue the calculation to determine the number of ice cubes placed in the third minute. We already have:

- Ice cubes in the first minute = 4
- Ice cubes in the second minute = 5

Therefore, the calculation for the ice cubes placed in the third minute is:

Ice cubes in the third minute = 15 - (4 + 5)  
Ice cubes in the third minute = 15 - 9  
Ice cubes in the third minute = 6

Step 6: Now, we need to determine the total number of ice cubes present in the pan at the end of the third minute. We've already established the number of ice cubes added each minute:

- At the start of the first minute:Step 5: Step 7: To find the total number of ice cubes present in the pan at the end of the third minute, we need to add up all the ice cubes placed in the pan during the first, second, and third minutes. We have already calculated the number of ice cubes placed in each minute:

- Ice cubes in the first minute = 4
- Ice cubes in the second minute = 5
- Ice cubes in the third minute = 6

Now, we sum these quantities to determine the total number of ice cubes in the pan at the end of the third minute:

Total ice cubes at the end of the third minute = Ice cubes in the first minute + Ice cubes in the second minute + Ice cubes in the third minuteStep 6: Step 8: Calculate the total number of ice cubes in the pan at the end of the third minute by summing the number of ice cubes placed in each of the three minutes:

- Ice cubes in the first minute = 4
- Ice cubes in the second minute = 5
- Ice cubes in the third minute = 6

Total ice cubes at the end of the third minute = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15

Step 9: Now, let's verify that the total number of ice cubes placed matches the condition of the average number of ice cubes per minute being five. We calculated the total number of ice cubes as 15, and the frying process lasted for 3 minutes:

Average ice cubes perStep 7: Let's continue from Step 9 to verify the average number of ice cubes per minute and confirm the solution.

Step 9: We calculated that the total number of ice cubes placed over the three minutes was 15. The problem states that the average number of ice cubes per minute was five. We can verify this by dividing the total number of ice cubes by the number of minutes:

Average ice cubes per minute = Total ice cubes / Number of minutes
Average ice cubes per minute = 15 / 3 = 5

This confirms that our calculation of the total number of ice cubes is correct and matches the given average.

Final Answer: E

The total number of ice cubes present in the pan at the end of the third minute is 15Step 8: To determine the next logical step, let's first ensure that the problem is completely solved. The steps so far have already led to the correct calculation of the total number of ice cubes at the end of the third minute. We calculated that 4 ice cubes were placed in the first minute, 5 in the second minute, and 6 in the third minute, resulting in a total of 15 ice cubes, which matches the condition of an average of 5 ice cubes per minute over 3 minutes.

Upon reviewing, it appears that the question asks how many "whole ice cubes canStep 10: Let's clarify the problem and the given options:

1. **Reinterpret the problem statement**: We are asked how many whole ice cubes can be found in the pan at the end of the third minute.

2. **Check for melting or disappearance**: The problem does not mention any melting or removal of ice cubes, so we assume all ice cubes placed in the pan remain whole until the end of the third minute.

3. **Recalculate the total number of ice cubes**:
   - First minute: 4 ice cubes
   - Second minute: 5 ice cubes
   - Third minute: 6 ice cubes (from our previous steps)
   
   Total ice cubes at the end of the third minute = 4 + 5Step 11: Step 11: Let's finalize the calculation for the total number of ice cubes at the end of the third minute based on the corrected understanding:

- Ice cubes placed in the first minute = 4
- Ice cubes placed in the second minute = 5
- Ice cubes placed in the third minute = 6

Total ice cubes at the end of the third minute = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
